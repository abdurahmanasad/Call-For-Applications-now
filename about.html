The Organizing Committee of the International Conference on AI-Powered Emerging Technology and Data Science invites scholars, researchers, educators, and practitioners to submit their papers for presentation at the conference, to be held on September 25-26, in Stellenbosch University  & University of the Western Cape, Faculty of Education. This interdisciplinary conference will bring together academics, researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to explore the evolving role of AI in shaping higher education. The event will focus on fostering dialogue, presenting cutting-edge research, and sharing innovative practices to address the challenges and opportunities of AI integration in education. We invite submissions for papers, presentations, and panels that explore the intersections of AI, education, and society. Submissions should align with one or more of the proposed conference themes.
</p>

<p>
This interdisciplinary event will serve as a dynamic and collaborative platform, bringing together a wide range of participants, including scholars, researchers, educators, industry experts, technology innovators, and policymakers. As emerging technologies, particularly Artificial Intelligence (AI), and data science continue to advance at an unprecedented pace, their role in shaping higher education is becoming increasingly profound, influencing virtually every aspect of the educational ecosystem. From pedagogy and curriculum design to student support services and administrative operations, these technologies are fundamentally revolutionizing how we approach teaching and learning in the 21st century.
</p>

<p>
The conference will explore how emerging technologies like AI, machine learning, and big data are transforming traditional educational models and presenting new possibilities for personalized, data-driven learning experiences. AI enables adaptive learning technologies that adjust to the individual needs of students, fostering more effective, customized education that can better support diverse learning styles and paces. Through the power of data science, educators are now able to analyse vast amounts of student data, uncovering patterns and insights that can guide both teaching strategies and institutional policies, improving student engagement and outcomes on a scale never before possible.
</p>

<p>
Participants will engage with cutting-edge research, case studies, and thought leadership on the evolving landscape of AI and data science in education, addressing how these technologies are reshaping the very fabric of educational delivery. The conference will highlight real-world applications of emerging technologies in the classroom, from AI-powered tutoring systems that offer real-time feedback to virtual learning environments that adapt based on students' progress. Additionally, it will address how data science is being used to predict student performance, optimize curricula, and support institutional decision-making with predictive analytics and evidence-based practices.
</p>

<p>
Through this event, attendees will explore how the integration of AI and data science is driving a shift towards more efficient, flexible, and scalable educational systems. These advancements are not only making learning more accessible but also providing educators with powerful tools to better meet the needs of all students, enabling them to develop and implement innovative teaching methodologies that were previously unimaginable. Moreover, the conference will highlight the ethical and societal implications of these technologies, including issues of data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the digital divide, ensuring that the benefits of these innovations are equitably distributed.
</p>

<p>
Given the interdisciplinary nature of the conference, it will provide a unique opportunity to bridge the gap between academic research, technological development, and policy formulation. Attendees will be encouraged to consider how emerging technologies can be used to solve some of the most pressing challenges in education, such as improving access to quality education in underserved regions, enhancing learner outcomes, and promoting lifelong learning. Ultimately, this event will serve as a vital space for thought-provoking discussions and the exchange of innovative ideas, offering a forward-looking view on how emerging technologies and data science are revolutionizing higher education. By embracing these advancements, educational institutions can unlock new potentials for teaching and learning, ensuring that they are prepared to meet the evolving needs of students, educators, and the broader society.
